# AWS CloudWatch - Use Syntetics Monitoring for Website Monitoring
- You can use Amazon CloudWatch Synthetics to create canaries, configurable scripts that run on a schedule, to monitor your endpoints and APIs. Canaries follow the same routes and perform the same actions as a customer, which makes it possible for you to continually verify your customer experience even when you don't have any customer traffic on your applications. By using canaries, you can discover issues before your customers do.
- Canaries are scripts written in Node.js or Python. They create Lambda functions in your account that use Node.js or Python as a framework. Canaries work over both HTTP and HTTPS protocols.
- Canaries offer programmatic access to a headless Google Chrome Browser via Puppeteer or Selenium Webdriver.
