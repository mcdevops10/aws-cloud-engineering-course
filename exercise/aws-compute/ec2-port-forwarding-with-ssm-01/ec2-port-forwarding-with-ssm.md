# AWS EC2 - Port-forward RDS Database through SSM
- The purpose of this excercise is to demonstrate the capabilities of EC2 SSM Session Manager Port Forwarding. You can learn how to Port Forward the RDS Database port from a Private VPC.

## Requirements
- Create a VPC with 2 private Subnet (no interent connectivity)
- Create VPC Endpoints (this is required if you don't have internet connectivity)
    - SSM
    - SSMMessages
    - EC2Messages
- Create an Ec2 Instance (Have an Instance Profile with a managed policy (SSMManagedInstanceCore)) within the VPC Private Subnets
- Create an RDS Database within the VPC Private Subnets
- Don't forget to configure AWS CLI and a Session Manager Plugin
- Issue the appropriate commands
- Clean Up! Don't forget to delete the resources!

## Tips and Tricks
#### Port Forwarding Command
```sh
aws ssm start-session \                   
    --target  i-0b4d63c26f6c30079 \
    --document-name AWS-StartPortForwardingSessionToRemoteHost \
    --parameters '{"host":["xxxx.xxx.rds.amazonaws.com"],"portNumber":["5432"], "localPortNumber":["5432"]}' --region eu-central-1
```

#### Connecting to the Database using PSQL tool
```sh
psql --host=127.0.0.1 --port=5432 --username=postgres --password --dbname=postgres
