# AWS EC2 - Using Elastic IP Address
An _Elastic IP address_ is a static IPv4 address designed for dynamic cloud computing. In the following excercise I would like you to discover how does it work, by creating resources.

The Purpose of this exercise is to demonstrate how to use Elastic IP addreses.

## Requirements
1. Create An Elastic IP Address
1. Create An EC2 Instance
    - Public Subnet
    - Have SSH Key pairs deployed with it
1. Associate the Instance with the Elastic IP Address
    - Look at what happens with the isntance
    - Make your conclusions

## Desired Architecture
