# AWS EFS - Mount EFS from a Different VPC (same Region)
The purpose of this excercise is to demonstrate how to mount EFS File Systen to an EC2 Instance, from a different VPC. 

## Requirements
- Create 2 different VPC
    - don't have overlapping CIDR Ranges
    - have matching AZs (the EFS Mount Point and EC2 needs to be in the same AZ)
- Create the EFS in VPC 1
- Create the EC2 in VPC 2
- Mount the EFS to EC2
- Clean Up! Don't Forget to Delete Your Resources!

## Tips and Tricks
#### Installing EFS-Helper on Amazon Linux 2
```sh
sudo yum install -y amazon-efs-utils
```

#### Adding a Host Entry for the Mount Target
```sh
echo "<mount target ip> <efs id>.efs.<region>.amazonaws.com" | sudo tee -a /etc/hosts
