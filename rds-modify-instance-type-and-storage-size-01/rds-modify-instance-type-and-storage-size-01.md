# AWS RDS - Modifying Instance Type (with near to Zero Downtime) and Modifying Storage Size (PostgreSQL)
In the following lecture I would like to demonstrate how to modify the Type of an RDS Database Instance with `near to zero` downtime. This method involves enabling High Availability Feature of RDS Instances with sync replication.

And as definition, DB parameter group acts as a container for engine configuration values that are applied to one or more DB instances. 

## Requirements
1. Create an RDS PostgreSQL Database (for myself at the point of recording v15.3 was used as Database Engine)
    - Use the Default Parameter Group (PGD)
    - Don't enable Multi AZ By Default
1. Add a MultiAZ Capabilities
1. Modify Instance Class
    1. Examine the connection during the Change
1. Force Failover after the Istance Class Change (because the primary node is in the (secondary AZ))
    1. Examine the connection during the Change
1. Disable Multi AZ
1. Increase Storage Size

## Tips and Tricks
#### Connecting to PostgreSQL Database
```sh
psql "host=<db hostname> port=5432 user=postgres dbname=postgres"
```

#### Show Server IP Address PostgreSQL Query
```sql
SELECT inet_server_addr();
```
